if gij = 0
there is no edge from i to j, 
so if i's outdegree was 0 so far, it remains so.
however since the indegree must be V-1, j cannot be the sink
since there is not incoming edge i->j

if gij = 1
there is an edge i->j
hence i is no universal sink
however if the previous gik for k<j were 0, then none of the ks are universal sinks
j could be one, so we try from Gjk k>j onwards.


int s = 0;

for(int k=0; k<V; k++)
{
	if(Gsk == 0)
	{
		
	}
	else
	{
		s = k;
	}
}


// s is the only possible element that is a sink, but it might noe be so check
// the conditions
return isSink(s)?s:-1;
